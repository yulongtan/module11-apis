### Exercise 1 ###

# Load the httr and jsonlite libraries for accessing data
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)

## For these questions, look at the API documentation to identify the appropriate endpoint and information.
## Then send GET() request to fetch the data, then extract the answer to the question

# For what years does the API have statistical data?
response <- GET('http://data.unhcr.org/api/stats/time_series_years.json')
years <- fromJSON(content(response, 'text'))
years

# What is the "country code" for the "Syrian Arab Republic"?
countries <- GET('http://data.unhcr.org/api/countries/list.json')
countries.body <- fromJSON(content(countries, 'text'))
View(countries.body)

countries.body %>% 
  filter(name_en == 'Syrian Arab Republic') %>% 
  select(country_code) %>% 
  print()

# How many persons of concern from Syria applied for residence in the USA in 2013?
# Hint: you'll need to use a query parameter
# Use the `str()` function to print the data of interest
# See http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/who-we-help.html for details on these terms

query.params <- list(year = 2013, country_of_origin = 'SYR', 
                     country_of_residence = 'USA')
concern.response <- GET('http://data.unhcr.org/api/stats/persons_of_concern.json',
                        query = query.params)
concern.body <- fromJSON(content(concern.response, 'text')) %>% 
  View()


## And this was only 2013...


# How many *refugees* from Syria settled the USA in all years in the data set (2000 through 2013)?
# Hint: check out the "time series" end points

year.params <- list(population_type_code = 'RF', country_of_origin = 'SYR', 
                    country_of_residence = 'TUR')
year.response <- GET('http://data.unhcr.org/api/stats/time_series_all_years.json',
                     query = year.params)
year.body <- fromJSON(content(year.response, 'text'))

# Use the `plot()` function to plot the year vs. the value.
# Add `type="o"` as a parameter to draw a line

plot(year.body$year, year.body$value, type = 'o')

# Pick one other country in the world (e.g., Turkey).
# How many *refugees* from Syria settled in that country in all years in the data set (2000 through 2013)?
# Is it more or less than the USA? (Hint: join the tables and add a new column!)
# Hint: To compare the values, you'll need to convert the data (which is a string) to a number; try using `as.numeric()`



## Bonus (not in solution):
# How many of the refugees in 2013 were children (between 0 and 4 years old)?


## Extra practice (but less interesting results)
# How many total people applied for asylum in the USA in 2013?
# - You'll need to filter out NA values; try using `is.na()`
# - To calculate a sum, you'll need to convert the data (which is a string) to a number; try using `as.numeric()`


## Also note that asylum seekers are not refugees
